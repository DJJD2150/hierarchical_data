# Hierarchical Data
## What this project is for:
This application is a Kenzie Academy assessment called "Hierarchical Data and You" where we are supposed to make a database with a tree-based structure so that way we learn how to sort data using parent and children elements as folders to organize different types of data files.

## What packages/ dependencies this project utilizes:
The project makes use of the Modified Preorder Tree Traversal (MPTT) so we can understand how to manage data this way.
